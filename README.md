## Top Rack Threads Co. 
This project is an e-commerce site for a conceptual clothing brand. It was made using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and the Fake Store API.

## Features
The goal of this website project was to create an interactive e-commerce site that provides an easy and comfortable experience for shoppers. This was achieved with the following features:

* Completely mobile and desktop responsive in a way that meets current standards and provides an appealing user experience.
* The ability to add to a persistent cart in any way the customer wants and have the cart memorize the customer's choices site-wide
  * This was achieved with useContext, useRef, and useState within React JS
* The ability to view individual items within the same page and have each page share content
  * The useContext hook in ReactJS was invaluable to achieve this
* The ability for the cart to be fully modifiable to the user to aid in their experience
* To be presentable in a way that a shopper can easily access all of the information on an item and make purchases without hassle
  
## Lessons and Takeaways
This was the first project where I wanted to make use of context within ReactJS. I figured an e-commerce site would not only be perfect for this, but also highly applicable to a real life website. Initially this took some getting used to, and most of the time at the beginning of this project was spent pouring over React documentation but allowed me to improve my React knowledge significantly. 

Additionally, this is the first project where I wanted to make it a point to use an API. The Fake Store API was relatively easy to use and gave me a lot of insight on how API rendering can improve workflow significantly. 

If I were to make this website again, I would like to add more pages and more items. Ideally, a browseable products section, and an expanded product info page.
